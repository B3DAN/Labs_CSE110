My name is Aedan and I am **_Very_** excited for CSE 110! 
                                                  <sub> Though I am a little anxious </sub>
(Styling Text)                                                  

I was intrigued by the Professor's memes, they really grabbed my attention (Quoting Text)
> What I'm saying may sound Sus
  - Thomas A. Powell

Primarily though I am interested in a few things (unordered list)
  - Becoming a good teammate
  - Learning what software Development is really about
  - Aspiring to be a better programmer

I did have a little trouble with the first part of this assignment, specifically the `git commit` command (Quoting code)

But videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) give me hope. (External Link)

For a little more basic information, [check out my README](https://github.com/B3DAN/Labs_CSE110/blob/2b69929e67fe332004ff456771dc15c468268f9f/README.md). (Relative Link)

Personally though, if I had to list some of my favorite things, they would be:
1. Snowboarding
2. Seeing fluffy dogs
3. Participating in class
(Ordered List)

But overall, my goals for this class are simple
- [X] Attend the first class
- [ ] Attend the last class
(Task List)

Thank you for reading my index file!
